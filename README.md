Pointers in c can be a very useful tool only when used in a proper way. This rep contains a sample for pointers which if tweaked in a improper way, will generate a simple yet difficult to solve error(Difficult only to new developers).
So try out testing this code with different kinds of datatypes for pointers.

P.S. 
If you understand the concept of datatypes and memory sizes properly, you should not have any issues acing this(Remember to revise casting with datatypes)
